# R for Data Science

Work through the renowned book [__R for Data Science__](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund.


## The gist

Incorporate the exercises and their results with the text of the book.

## Setup

As described in the book:
- R
- RStudio
- tidyverse library and other packages

## Evolving Workflow

Learn and learn well. This is not a copy and paste exercise, but here is the evolution:

1. The paperback, a pencil and a straightedge (protractor) underlining key concepts, copying text from the digital edition into .R comments
2. .Rmd's
3. .md's for GitHub

When suitable for learning, which is very often, type whatever needs typing - e.g.: the first time a concept is encountered, or anytime learning by doing is increased. Else, copy and paste from source for efficiency. 

## Hat Tip

BIG, BIG kudos to Hadley and team for opensourcing the material, not only the digital book version, but also the markdowns and methods!

## Files

File Type | Usage
--------- | -----
.R        | Comments are blended book text and personal notes, code is often blended as well 
--------- | -----
.Rmd      | Interactive markdown
--------- | -----
.md       | Presentational markdown

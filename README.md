# R for Data Science

Work through the book [__R for Data Science__](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund.

Combine the text with output from code chunks and plots with also my answers to the exercises. 

## Setup

As described in the book:
- R
- RStudio
- tidyverse library and other packages

## Putpose and Evolution

The purpose is to learn and learn well. 

1. I did by the paperback and started underlining key concepts, etc., old school. 
2. Then I started copying text from the digital copy into .R files as comments, reading as I went, and coding the exercises.
3. Then I started copying the text from the raw views of the .Rmd files on Wickham's repo into my own .Rmd files, again reading as I went and  coding the exercises.
4. It would be easy enough to fork Wickham's repo or even create my own bookdown, and eventually I might do that with my own results integrated ... However - going back to the purpose of learning the material - the point is not to make this a copy and paste exercise. By going through every line, every word, and absorbing them while formatting and notating for my own purposes, that is the most informative process for me.  

## Hat Tip

BIG, BIG kudos to Hadley and team for open-sourcing the material, not only the digital book version, but also the markdowns and methods!

## Files

File Type | Usage
--------- | -----.
.R | Comments are book text and personal notes, plus code 
.Rmd      | Interactive markdown
.md       | Presentational markdown (tried this, but better to knitr html_document with self contined images to post to website)

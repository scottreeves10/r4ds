# R for Data Science

Work through the book [__R for Data Science__](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund.

Integrate my notes and exercise answers with book content. 

## Setup

As described in the book:
- R
- R Studio
- tidyverse library and other packages

## Methodology

The purpose is to learn and learn well. 

1. Bought the paperback. Using that at times, old school.

2. Initially started copying key text from the digital copy into .R files as comments, and coding the exercises.

3. Then decided to copy the text from the raw views of the .Rmd files on Wickham's repo into my own .Rmd files, essentially reading the book as part of that process, and of course integrating the exercises.
    - front matter output: html_document to web to run code chunks and show plots
    
Note: It would be easy enough to fork Wickham's repo or even create my own bookdown, and eventually I might do that with my own results integrated ... However, the point is not to make this a copy and paste exercise. By going through every line, every word, and absorbing them while formatting and notating for my own purposes, that is the most informative process for me.  

## Hat Tip

BIG, BIG kudos to Hadley and team for open-sourcing the material, not only the digital book version, but also the markdowns and methods!

## Files

File Type | Usage
--------- | -----
.R        | Comments are book text and personal notes, plus code 
.Rmd      | Interactive markdown
